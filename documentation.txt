********** Node JS *****


Node js is not a framework, or not a langauge its a  "Server Enviroment"

********** "Two Type of Core Module **********

1. Globle (jinhain hmy import nhi krana prhta like console.log, we use this directly)
2. Non Globe (inhain import krana prhta ha) like file system  
e.g  const myFile=require('fs');


 ********** External Module **********

 ********** Package.lock.json file **********

Manage the detail of packages

********** How to create packages.json file

-> Go to terminal
-> write npm init
-> Then give all the informations to it 

********** How to install package **********

npm install package_name
also we write like npm i package_name

like, npm install axios


********** what is Nodemon **********

Nodemon is a package
Use to continusly run your node project.
we dont need to run command again and again, just click on save it save the changes and show the output

intall like 
-> Go to terminal
-> Write npm install nodemon

Also we intall it globle like
-> npm install nodemon -g

now for check file then run command like

nodemon .\file name 
like  nodemon .\nodemon.js


********** events **********

Kici file ka delete hona, read hona, open hona, close hona, aaisi cheezy jo server pr hori hoti ha, called event


********** Express JS *****

-> Web framework for node.js
-> Fast & Flexible (no limitations, no ristrictions)
-> Simple framework
-> Save Time
-> minimum line of code then node js
Installation
npm i express

********** EJS Template Engine *****
EJS STANDS FOR (Embedded Javascript Template)
// EJS is a Template Engine
// Use to rendor the dynamic data/pages
 like api values, database values etc


Firstly we need to install it
like npm i ejs
When we use EJS then we need to make a folder name (views). Bcz express views waly folder ko by default get kr lyta ha. 
if we put another name, then we need to define its path etc. Which is not good approach



********** Middle Ware *****

is like a function that is used to handle request and response cycle.
it apply only on routes
We mostly use this in authentication, error handling etc

Types:
-> application level middleware  (In this we apply middleware on all routes)
-> router level middleware  (In this we apply middleware on specific route)
-> build in middleware
-> error handle middleware
-> thirf party middleware
